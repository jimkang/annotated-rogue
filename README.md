==================

An attempt to annotate the [source](https://github.com/ctdk/bsdgames-osx/tree/master/rogue) for the version of Rogue that was distributed with BSD in 1987 ("rogue-clone: Version III").

Templates generated by [docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco) (in particular, this [fork](https://github.com/jimkang/docco), which is very aggressive about deciding when to make a new section).
