              <h1>Annotated Rogue source</h1>
              <p>
                  This is an attempt to annotate the <a href="https://github.com/ctdk/bsdgames-osx/tree/master/rogue">source</a> for the version of Rogue that was distributed with BSD in 1987.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's a reimplementation the original Rogue by Tim Stoehr and others that has an unambiguous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD license</a> and is fairly close to the original, according to <a href="https://rodneylives.itch.io/atplay">John Harris's book</a>. It's called "rogue-clone: Version III" in the source. It's buildable and playable on the OSes of 2016, including OS X 10.10.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can get the source for Rogue 3.6, a version of the original Rogue from 1981, at the <a href="http://rogue.rogueforge.net/rogue-3-6/">Roguelike Restoration Project</a>. It's going to be hard to compile, but it's still readable. I personally find Rogue Clone's source to be better organized, which probably follows from time Stoehr being able to start from scratch knowing exactly what to build.
